## A Block Chain Platform with Equipment ID for Industrial Internet


ABSTRACT


This study develops a blockchain-based and Internet of Things-based strategy for industrial equipment traceability. The primary data that is recorded in the internal traceability solution of the blockchain is the digital summary of the detailed traceability data and the important traceability data of industrial equipment. The detailed industrial equipment traceability information and digital summaries produced by the traceability information are mostly recorded by the traceability solution outside of the blockchain. The suggested traceability mechanism in this study guarantees the accuracy of all traceable data and prevents the issue of blockchain data explosion.
